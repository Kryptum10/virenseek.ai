<h1><p>what is AI?</p><h1>
<h2><p>AI, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artifical Interlligence</a><style> a:hover {color:cyan;}</style><style> a:link {color:pink;}</style>, refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and problem-solve like humans. AI can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as understanding language, recognizing patterns, making decisions, and even engaging in conversation.</p><h2><br>

<h2><p><b>DeepSeek <sup>(Chinese: 深度求索; pinyin: Shēndù Qiúsuǒ)</sup> is a Chinese artificial intelligence company that develops open-source large language models (LLM). Based in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, it is owned and solely funded by Chinese hedge fund High-Flyer, whose co-founder, Liang Wenfeng, established the company in <sub>2023</sub> and serves as its CEO.</b></p></h2><br>

	<h2><p>The DeepSeek-R1 model provides responses comparable to other contemporary LLMs, such<b> OpenAI's GPT-4o and o1</b>, despite being trained at a significantly lower cost—<u>stated at US$6 million compared to <strike>$100 million</strike> for <tt>OpenAI's GPT-4 </tt></u>in 2023—and requiring a tenth of the computing power of a comparable LLM. DeepSeek's A.I. models were developed amid United States sanctions on China for Nvidia chips, which were intended to <i>restrict the country's ability to develop advanced A.I. systems.</i></p></h2><br>
